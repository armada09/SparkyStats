You can download the csv file from here and populate it with your associate data. 
Note that dashboard and csv file gives users maximum flexibility. It allows users to design their own categories and genres. 

** However Sparky suggests the following guidelines:
- Put one category per book. E.g. for Harry Potter use magic.
- Make sure the month column in the csv column is propercase i.e. January, Feburary, etc...
- A maximum of 25 user created categories can be allowed. Sparky does suggest your max limit to 10 categories so your charts are more visible and clean.
- For genre name, use a maximum of 14 characters otherwise it will truncate.
- For author name, use a maximum of 14 characters otherwise it will truncate.
