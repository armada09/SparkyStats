Note that dashboard and csv file gives users maximum flexibility. It allows users to design their own categories and genres. 

** However Sparky suggests the following guidelines:
- Put one category per book. E.g. for Harry Potter use magic.
- Make sure the month column in the csv column is propercase i.e. January, Feburary, etc...
- A maximum of 25 user created categories can be allowed. Sparky does suggest your max limit to 10 categories so your charts are more visible and clean.
- For genre name, use a maximum of 14 characters otherwise it will truncate.
- For author name, use a maximum of 14 characters otherwise it will truncate.
